Hi there,
I pick Python 2.7.8, which happens to have been installed on my windows. Some syntax are different from other versions.
I named the 3 files task1.py to task3.py, according to the spec.
each file is independent of the others.
To simplify things, the files are scirpts.
For task1, instead of writing back to the original file, I write to a new log file to avoid any confusion for the latter 2 tasks.
For task2, the output format is ip , average/min and aveage/session(20min).
For task3, I put the coordinates in the turple(time,statuscode[numbers]) format and write them to a log file. I do this do avoid installing some plotting packages. I tried a couple and basically they take the similar format of input as I produced.
