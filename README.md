Hi there, <br />
I pick Python 2.7.8, which happens to have been installed on my windows. Some syntax are different from other versions.<br />
I named the 3 files task1.py to task3.py, according to the spec.<br />
each file is independent of the others.<br />
To simplify things, the files are scirpts.<br />
For task1, instead of writing back to the original file, I write to a new log file to avoid any confusion for the latter 2 tasks.<br />
For task2, the output format is ip , average/min and aveage/session(20min).<br />
For task3, I put the coordinates in the turple(time,statuscode[numbers]) format and write them to a log file. I do this do avoid installing some plotting packages. I tried a couple and basically they take the similar format of input as I produced.<br />
